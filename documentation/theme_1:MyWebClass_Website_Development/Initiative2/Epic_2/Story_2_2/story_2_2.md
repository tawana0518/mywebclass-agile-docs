As a developer, I want to use IaC to manage the configuration of our application servers so that we can quickly
deploy and update our applications in a consistent and repeatable manner.

Acceptance Criteria:

All application server configurations are managed using IaC tools.
The IaC code for configuring application servers is stored in a version control system.
All changes to application server configurations are made through the IaC code and deployed using a CI/CD pipeline.
The IaC code is tested and validated before deploying changes to production.
