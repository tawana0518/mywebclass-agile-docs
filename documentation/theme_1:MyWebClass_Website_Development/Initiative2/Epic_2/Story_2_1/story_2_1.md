As a DevOps engineer, I want to use infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision and configure our AWS infrastructure
so that we can reduce manual effort, increase consistency, and easily replicate environments.

Acceptance Criteria:

IaC code is written using a version control system (e.g., Git).
IaC code is tested and validated before deployment.
The infrastructure is provisioned and configured automatically using the IaC code.
The IaC code is reusable across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
Changes to the infrastructure are made only through the IaC code, and not through manual configuration in the AWS console.
The IaC code includes documentation for the infrastructure and its configuration.
