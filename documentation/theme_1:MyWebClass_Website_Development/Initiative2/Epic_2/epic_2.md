"Adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC)"

Description: We want to adopt IaC practices for managing our MyWebClass infrastructure so that we can automate the 
provisioning, configuration, and management of our infrastructure, reducing manual effort and increasing consistency 
across environments.

Goals: 
    1. Improve Infrastructure Management
    2. Automate Infrastructure Provisioning
    3. Reduce Errors
    4. Increase Efficiency

User Stories: 
    1. As a DevOps engineer, I want to use infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision and configure our AWS infrastructure
so that we can reduce manual effort, increase consistency, and easily replicate environments.
    2. As a developer, I want to use IaC to manage the configuration of our application servers so that we can quickly
deploy and update our applications in a consistent and repeatable manner.
    3. As a system administrator, I want to use IaC to automate the management of our database servers so that we can 
reduce the risk of human error and ensure consistent configuration across environments.

Dependencies: 
    1. Availability of appropriate IaC tools
    2. Availability of appropriate APIs and integrations 
    3. Availability of budget and resources to invest in IaC implementation 

Risks: 
    1. Complexity of Infrastructure:
    2. Inadequate Testing:
    3. Security Risks:
Mitigation:
    1. Conduct a thorough assessment of existing tools and processes to identify potential compatibility issues.
    2. Implement robust testing processes and incorporating testing into the development lifecycle.
    3. Incorporate security considerations into the IaC design and testing processes.

Estimated Effort: It could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to fully adopt IaC practices for managing the
infrastructure.
Things to consider:
    1. Identifying and defining the infrastructure components
    2. Creating the necessary scripts and templates for automation, testing the automation
    3. Integrating it into the existing workflow.

Business Value: 
    1. Reduced manual effort
    2. Increased consistency across environments
    3. Improved scalability and availability of the infrastructure.

Priority: High Priority
