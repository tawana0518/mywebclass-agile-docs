As a developer, I want to automate the build process using CI/CD tools so that I can ensure a consistent and 
reliable build process, reducing the risk of errors and increasing efficiency.


Acceptance Criteria:

The CI/CD tool must be able to automatically pull the latest source code from the version control system and initiate
the build process.
The build process must be able to detect and report any errors or failures.
The deployment process must be able to detect and report any errors or failures.
The build process should be able to run in a timely manner, ideally completing within a few minutes.
