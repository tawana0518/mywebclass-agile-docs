"Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)"

Description: we want to implement a CI/CD pipeline for MyWebClass development so that we can automate the build, testing, 
and deployment processes, reducing the manual effort required and increasing the speed of delivering features to our 
users.

Goals: 
    1. Automate the build and deployment process
    2. Increase development speed and agility
    3. Improve code quality
    4. Reduce deployment failures and downtime

User Stories: 
    1. As a developer, I want to automate the build process using CI/CD tools so that I can ensure a consistent and 
reliable build process, reducing the risk of errors and increasing efficiency.
    2. As a QA engineer, I want to automate the testing process using CI/CD tools so that I can ensure a consistent and 
reliable testing process, reducing the risk of errors and increasing efficiency.
    3. As a product owner, I want to automate the deployment process using CI/CD tools so that I can quickly and easily 
deploy new features and updates to users, reducing downtime and increasing user satisfaction.

Dependencies: 
    1. Availability of resources
    2. Integration of other systems
    3. Complexity of the project - more time and resources

Risks: 
    1. Technical Challenges
    2. Security Risks
    3. Inadequate Testing
Mitigation:
    1.  A thorough analysis of the existing infrastructure should be conducted before implementing CI/CD
    2. Proper security measures should be put in place, including access controls, secure coding practices, and regular 
vulnerability assessments.
    3. Testing should be a central part of the CI/CD process, with automated tests incorporated at every stage.

Estimated Effort: The exact amount of effort required will depend on the size and complexity of the website. Effort falls
in for creating a CI/CD pipeline, configuring various tools and services, and ensuring that all aspects of the process 
are properly integrated and working smoothly.

Business Value: 
    1. Faster time-to-market
    2. Improved quality
    3. Increased efficiency
    4. Cost savings

Priority: High Priority
