As a QA engineer, I want to automate the testing process using CI/CD tools so that I can ensure a consistent and 
reliable testing process, reducing the risk of errors and increasing efficiency.

Acceptance Criteria:

The CI/CD tool should be configured to automatically trigger test scripts upon successful completion of the build process.
The test scripts should be designed to cover all critical functionalities of the application and should include both 
functional and non-functional testing.
The test results should be reported automatically in a readable format.
The CI/CD tool should be integrated with the issue tracking system to automatically create and track defects for failed
test cases.
