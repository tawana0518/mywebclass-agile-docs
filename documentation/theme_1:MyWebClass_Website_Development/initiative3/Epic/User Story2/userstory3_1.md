Acceptance Criteria:

delete content.
The CMS features a WYSIWYG editor that allows administrators to easily format text and add images, videos, and other
multimedia elements to the webpage.
The CMS includes a workflow that allows multiple administrators to collaborate on content creation and review before
publishing to the live site.

content if necessary.
