As a website administrator, I want to be able to easily update and manage the content on the MyWebClass.org webpage so
that I can ensure that the information provided to users is up-to-date and accurate.

Acceptance Criteria:

The webpage includes a user-friendly content management system (CMS) that allows administrators to easily add, edit, and 
delete content.
The CMS features a WYSIWYG editor that allows administrators to easily format text and add images, videos, and other
multimedia elements to the webpage.
The CMS includes a workflow that allows multiple administrators to collaborate on content creation and review before
publishing to the live site.
The CMS includes version control and rollback features that allow administrators to revert to previous versions of 
content if necessary.
